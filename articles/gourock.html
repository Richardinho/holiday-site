<p>Gourock has one of the three remaining public outdoor swimming pools in Scotland. Gourock Outdoor Pool was
    built in 1909 and reconstructed in 1969, it was once tidal and had a sandy floor, but is now a modern, heated
    facility, with cleaned sea water used in the saltwater pool. The pool was closed at the end of the 2010 summer season
    for a major improvement project, due to be completed before the end of 2011. The existing changing accommodation has been
    demolished and will be replaced with a more modern leisure centre, incorporating an enlarged gymnasium and lift access from
    the street level down to the new changing accommodation and the upgraded pool.[2]</p>
<p>The megalithic Kempock Stone, popularly known as "Granny Kempock Stone", stands on a cliff behind Kempock Street, the main
    shopping street. The supersition was that for sailors going on a long voyage or a couple about to be married, walking seven
    times around the stone would ensure good fortune. A flight of steps winds up from the street past the stone to Castle Mansions
    and St John's Church, whose crown steeple forms a landmark dominating Gourock. Kempock Street itself has a good variety
    of traditional shops including baker's and greengrocer's shops.</p>
<p>Gourock also has a golf course, which stretches from behind Trumpethill to Levan estates.</p>
