<p>Dunoon is a highlands resort town on the Cowal Peninsula looking out across Holy Loch from the Firth of Clyde in the Argyll and Bute Council Area.</p>

<p>The first Dunoon Pier appeared in 1835. The pier was enlarged and a new waiting room constructed in 1867
    to cater for the growth of paddle-steamer traffic and this was further improved with a larger 400 foot jetty in 1881. The pier
    was again rebuilt in 1895 resulting in the two-berth structure broadly as it exists today, with the exception of the modern
    roll-on/roll-off facilities for vehicles which was added in 2004/5.</p>

<p>The pier entrance building is very striking with red-tiled roofs and strongly detailed timber in chocolate, cream and yellow.
    A promenade balcony erected in 1937 has not been renewed, though the much-altered entrance buildings from the Pier Esplanade do remain.</p>

<p>Overlooking the pier, is a large statue to Robert Burns' love Highland Mary, also known as Bonny Mary O' Argyll, which is located
    on Castle Hill, just below the remains of the 12th century Dunoon Castle.</p>

<p>Fleets of paddle steamers brought holidaymakers from Glasgow to Dunoon and many other piers right up to the late 1960s
    and the pier is still visited by the last sea-going paddle steamer in the world, P.S.Waverley. A regular
    car and passenger ferry service to Gourock Pier across the loch still operates, run by Caledonian MacBrayne.</p>
